I've successfully finished the task.
Html does not support scss extension, so I used use VSCode extension that compiles the code into simple css.
There are some things that I would change and improvise for example i would use more div for flexibility and simple css, but I stayed with this solution for the requiermetns
I really hope I you like my solution because i'm loking forward to work with you
